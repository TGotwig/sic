# Simple Image Converter (sic)
Converts a single image from one format to another.

The image conversion is actually done by the awesome [image](https://crates.io/crates/image) crate  :balloon:.
`sic` is thus a small command line frontend which supports a small portion of the conversion operations supported by the __image__ crate.

It was actually created to try out another awesome Rust library:  [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) :tada:
