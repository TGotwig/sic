sic is an image crate[1], CLI front-end. It allows you to perform image operations on images and to convert images between formats from the CLI.

Currently, the following input (decoding) formats are supported:
* BMP, GIF, DDS, Farbfeld, ICO, JPEG, PNG, PBM, PGM, PPM, PAM, TGA, TIFF and WebP

The following output (encoding) formats are supported:
* BMP, GIF, Farbfeld, ICO, JPEG, PNG, PBM, PGM, PPM, PAM, TIFF

For both encoding and decoding, some formats are partly supported (i.e. limitation may apply).
Animated images are currently not supported, however a specific image frame may be selected if the image is a GIF.
Other limitations can be found at:
