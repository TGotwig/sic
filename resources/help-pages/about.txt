sic is an image crate[1], CLI front-end. It allows you to perform image operations on images and to convert images to different formats from the CLI.

Formats
-------

Currently, the following input (decoding) formats are supported:
* BMP, GIF, DDS, Farbfeld, ICO, JPEG, PNG, PBM, PGM, PPM, PAM, TGA, TIFF and WebP

The following output (encoding) formats are supported:
* BMP, GIF, Farbfeld, ICO, JPEG, PNG, PBM, PGM, PPM, PAM, TIFF

For both encoding and decoding, some formats are partly supported (i.e. limitation may apply).
Animated images are currently not supported, however a specific image frame may be selected if the image is a GIF.
Other limitations can be found at:

Glob patterns
-------------

By default, sic's --input and --output arguments expect a single input image and output image respectively.
When using glob mode by setting --mode to 'glob', the --input argument expects to receive a single glob pattern instead.
You may need to provide quotation marks around the pattern, so your shell will not superfluously expand the pattern.
The --output argument should be given an output folder instead of a file path.

Output image files will mirror the path (from the first common directory) from their respective input image paths in the output folder.
If output folders do not exist, sic will attempt to create them for you.

A thank you and request
-----------------------

We would like to explicitly state that the sic authors are not affiliated with the image crate authors.
We do like to thank them for creating and maintaining an amazing set of libraries however!
